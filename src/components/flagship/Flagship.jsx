By creating a favorable tax environment, we will empower the next generation to lead in sustainable industries, driving both economic growth and environmental responsibility.</em></h2>
                <p><strong>This policy will simplify regulatory processes, reduce bureaucratic red tape, and ensure that small businesses and entrepreneurs can thrive in Canadaâ€™s green economy.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Through these initiatives, we aim to create a "Sustainable Progress" where every citizen has the opportunity to thrive in a society that is just, equitable, and sustainable. Our vision is of a Canada where progress and prosperity are shared by all.</strong></p>

The Strong and Free Party will therefore get more housing built for common Canadians and ensure a greater level of fiscal accountability and transparency.</strong></p> */}
